## Project Management
DataFibers' issues and kanban borad are two very important tools we are using for DataFibers management and delivery.
* [Issue List](https://github.com/datafibers-community/df_data_service/issues) - This is where we log all backlog items
* [Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/datafibers-community/projects/1?fullscreen=true) - This is where we manage and track the progress of work items.

## How to Contribute
* Fork DF master branch to your own repository.
* Switch to the latest branch.
* Work on the code with your preferred Java IDE.
* Once done, checkin your code changes to your own GitHub repository.
* Create a branch pull request from **your_github_repo.development_YYYYMM** to **df_github_repo.development_YYYYMM**.
* Do proper code merge and changes until you can successfully send the pull request.
* The other DataFibers developers will review, comment, and approve your pull request and merge to **df_github_repo.development_YYYYMM**.
* At the end of every month, release team will merge the monthly development branch to the master having changes from all pulled. All issues related in the [Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/datafibers-community/projects/1?fullscreen=true) at ***Done & To Be Merged*** area will be closed and removed from the Kanban.
* Then, a new branch will be created for the next month as active development branch.

## How to Debug
There are generally two ways to debug in DF applications
### Server Debug
Server debug is to run server application in debug mode. In this case, we still keep DF dependecy environment, such as Kafka, running inside of VirtualBox, but to run the DF Data Service as server in debug mode outside of VirtualBox.

In order to make this work, we'll need to reforward DF appliation related port, such as 8000 (for UI) and 8080 (for REST Service) to other port number, such as 8000 to 7000, to make it avaliable for the DF application outside of VirtualBox as follows.

</p>

Also, make sure all of the DF dependecy application, such as Kafka, ZooKeeper, have their port forward outside of VirtualBox. Then, we can debug run the entrance function at DFInitService.main().

### Client Debug
Client side debug is to run client application in debug mode by connecting full DF service in the VirtualBox. All port forwarding should be in place to work in this mode. For features closely related to the DF dependecy application, such as Kafka, ZooKeeper, Flink, etc, you can easily use this mode.

If you meet any exception regarding to connection timeout especially on Kafka or MongoDB, you can refer to the [troubleshooting area](troubleshooting_area.html#Vagarant_Issues) in this guideline.
